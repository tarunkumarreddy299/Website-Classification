# Website Classification into Phishing or Legitimate Using Machine Learning
- Websites are classified using several Machine Learning algorithms.
- A webiste is classified into Phishing and legitimate using various parameters of the website. 
- Several Machine learning algorithms and techniques were used, including Cross Validation, Hyperparameter tuning and Feature selection.
- This project was part of the Machine Learning course at Sai University.
- Detailed analysis and report is attached in the file 'Website classification report.pdf'
